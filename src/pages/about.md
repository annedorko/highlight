# What I Do!

I help people with big visions find the right steps to make them happen through research, planning, automation, and optimization.

Business is more than a means to an end: I’m passionate about creative expression, ethics, and making the world a better place. I am a lifelong student of both humanities and technology. Without perspective and context, the rest is meaningless. Let’s build your legacy with purpose!

## About Me

By day, I am a contractor.

By night, I am an avid reader, mindfulness practitioner, songwriter, music producer, online community leader, musician, volunteer customer support, volunteer widget maker, AeroPress coffee drinker, designer, writer, web developer, productivity geek, content creator, Bullet Journal fanatic, and mental health advocate.
